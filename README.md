**Calories Burnt Prediction ML Model**

**Introduction:**
This project focuses on predicting the calories burnt during exercise using machine learning techniques. It utilizes data obtained from Kaggle to create a predictive model. The primary aim is to assist individuals in understanding and optimizing their exercise routines for better health outcomes.

**Dependencies:**
The project utilizes several Python libraries including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. Additionally, it employs the XGBoost regressor for model training.

**Data Pre-processing:**
The data is loaded from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames and pre-processed to combine relevant information. Missing values are checked and no pre-processing is required. Textual data like gender is converted into numerical values for model compatibility.

**Data Analysis:**
Statistical measures are derived from the dataset to understand its characteristics. Descriptive statistics are used to gain insights into the distribution of variables.

**Data Visualization:**
Visualization techniques such as count plots and distribution plots are employed to visually analyze the data. Heatmaps are used to understand correlations between different features, highlighting the relationships between duration, heart rate, body temperature, and calories burnt.

**Model Training:**
The XGBoost regressor model is utilized for training. The data is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function. The model is trained on the training data to learn patterns and relationships.

**Model Evaluation:**
The trained model is evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) to assess its accuracy in predicting calories burnt. The obtained MAE indicates the degree of error in the predictions, with lower values suggesting higher accuracy.

**Conclusion**
The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict calories burnt during exercise. By leveraging data-driven insights, individuals can optimize their exercise routines for improved health and fitness outcomes. The provided model serves as a valuable tool for guiding exercise planning and monitoring progress.
